# Helsinki Type Studio Exploring Unicode

HTS-X is an exploration of the Unicode standard in OTF format.
All glyphs are 1000 units wide and 1000 high.

Anyone can **contribute** a new glyph (fork and pull request)

or

Get in touch in the **Discussions** section if you cant to become a **collaborator**.

# How to...

## fork and pull request in browser

(assuming you have a Github account)

1. **Fork** the repository

2. **Code** -> **Download as zip** -> open on your computer

3. Add any random unicode to the OTF

4. **Upload file** to your forked repository on Github with the **commit message** of your unicode number. For example the first ever character was the asterisk, with the unicode number `U+002A` so the message is simply "U+002A" **Commit directly to the main branch.**

5. Make a **Pull request**

X. Done! Helsinki Type Studio will merge your pull request to the main repository if it is not overwriting any existing characters.
