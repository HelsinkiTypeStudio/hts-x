# How to...

## fork and pull request in browser

(0. assuming you have a Github account)

1. **Fork** the repository

2. **Code** -> **Download as zip** -> open on your computer

3. Add any random unicode to the OTF

4. **Upload file** to your forked repository on Github with the **commit message** of your unicode number. **Commit directly to the main branch.**

example

The first ever character was the asterisk, with the unicode number `U+002A` so the message is simply "U+002A"

X. Done! Helsinki Type Studio will merge your pull request to the main repository if it is not overwriting any existing characters.
